It’s best had piping hot. It’s one of those things that everyone just loves to eat. The crispy crust, the spicy filling! Is there anyone who doesn’t love it? Nah! A well made samosa is everyone’s best friend.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of recipes out there this one is a little different. It’s my mom’s personal recipe. It doesn’t contain onion, ginger or garlic and  since it’s relatively light on chilli(compared to every samosa I’ve had out there) it is great for people who cannot tolerate the heat. It’s primarily spiced with ‘amchur’ or dried mango powder which gives the samosas their signature tang without being too overwhelming on the tongue.</p>

<p>This is an easy recipe and if you have all the ingredients it comes together in roughly, an hour. So, without further ado, onward to la recette!</p>

<p><b>Bonus:</b> Scroll down to see the baking instructions included at the bottom.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><i>For the crust/covering</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>250 grams maida (all-purpose flour), sifted</li>
  <li>60 grams sunflower oil</li>
  <li>2 grams ajwain (carom seeds)</li>
  <li>4-5 grams Salt or according to your taste.</li>
  <li>70-75 grams water (can vary according to the exact flour used)</li>
</ul>

<p><i>For the filling</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>40 grams mustard oil</li>
  <li>1 gram cumin seeds</li>
  <li>600 grams potatoes</li>
  <li>2 grams cumin powder</li>
  <li>2 grams coriander powder</li>
  <li>6 grams amchur powder</li>
  <li>2 grams garam masala powder</li>
  <li>2 grams red chilli powder</li>
  <li>40 grams peas</li>
  <li>5 grams salt</li>
  <li>A small bowl of water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the dough by pouring the oil into the maida. Add ajwain and salt. Rub the oil into the maida with your fingers and between your palms in a back and forth motion so that the oil is properly incorporated and the maida looks like crumbly sand.  Add water very gradually and start kneading with a light hand. Dough should be stiff. If it’s soft that means you have added way too much water. When the dough comes together, cover with a cheesecloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. This will allow to get hydrated and it will be more pliable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the filling peel and boil the potatoes. Cool and mash them roughly within your fist. Simultaneously, heat mustard oil in a pan. Keep the flame low and add cumin seeds. When the cumin seeds start sputtering, add the potatoes and ‘turn’ them over with a spatula so that they get coated with the tempered oil. Now add all the powdered masalas. Cook the potatoes on low flame for 4-5 minutes until the potatoes leave the sides. Add peas and cook for another minute. Keep stirring the potatoes so that they cook evenly and don’t get burnt. Take the filling off the flame and cool.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/tansam/02_SDG_3964.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oil your surface moderately. Divide the dough into 50 gram balls and roll them out, one at a time, into a circle of at least 6 inches. Alternatively, you can also use a pastry ring to cut out the circles. Use a sharp knife to cut the rolled out dough circle into half.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use your index finger to rub water lengthwise along this cut. Now take one semi-circle into your hand by pinching the edges and make a cone by bringing the edges together, overlapping one above the other, and sealing the entire seam. Press lightly along the seam to make sure they are sealed.

<img src="/assets/blog_img/tansam/04_SDG_3973.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Holding this steadily, gently, like an ice cream cone, in your left hand, take a little filling in your right hand and stuff it into the ‘samosa cone’ pushing it  into the very tip. The samosa shouldn’t be stuffed recklessly or under-stuffed because you will not be able to seal it or it will be flat and misshapen respectively. Take care not to stretch the dough when you are filling it. Leave 1 cm space at the top, use your right index finger to rub water along the periphery and seal the seams with a pinching motion of your fingers. Make sure that you seal the vertical seam to the middle of the samosa, otherwise your samosas run the risk of being ‘flat’.

<img src="/assets/blog_img/tansam/07_SDG_3984.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the samosas and heat your oil. The ideal temperature at which these goodies should be fried is 160°C Any hotter and your samosas will blister on the surface. When you put the samosas in the hot oil you should see only tiny bubbles with no violent activity on the surface. If the oil smokes and spits excessively then the oil is too hot. Turn the heat down and wait for the correct temperature before you start frying.

  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Baked samosas:</b> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the samosas with space in between them. Brush them with oil and bake at 180°C for 20-25 minutes. They should be golden when they are ready.</p>

<p><b>Serving suggestion:</b> Samosas are ideally served with a dhania chutney/mint chutney and a sweet imli chutney. In a pinch, it can also be served with tomato ketchup. Pairs well with  a cup of hot adrak chai and with a little yogurt you can even turn it into samosa chaat.</p>

<p>I managed to get my hands on some beetroots recently and since I adore hummus, I decided to take it up a notch and give beetroot hummus a try. It’s such a delicious, versatile dip that can be paired with carrots, crackers, pita bread, sandwiches and burgers and it looks amazing. I usually end up eating it with toasted bread or carrots when I need a snack.</p>

<p>I have not added any chilli to this recipe because I didn’t want it to be too spicy. It’s packed with plant-based protein, other essential minerals and fiber (thank you, beetroots!). I have found when I get snacky, having something healthy like hummus in the fridge cuts down on the possibility of ordering takeout!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/02_SDG_4105.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>

<p>If you have the ingredients (don’t forget to soak the chickpeas in water for at least 8 hours prior) this recipe can be finished in thirty minutes or less. I like tahini so I usually put it in every time I make hummus, but if you don’t have tahini or don’t like it you can just skip it. This recipe calls for a fair amount of garlic but you can definitely add more or less, if that’s how you prefer it.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><i>(for step 1)</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>80 grams chickpeas</li>
  <li>300 grams water</li>
  <li>25 grams garlic</li>
  <li>2 grams salt</li>
</ul>

<p><i>(for step 2 and onwards)</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>7 grams garlic</li>
  <li>3 grams salt</li>
  <li>30 grams olive oil</li>
  <li>125 grams water</li>
  <li>22 grams lime juice</li>
  <li>25 grams ice cubes</li>
  <li>20 grams tahini</li>
  <li>30 grams roasted beetroot</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Garnish</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>White sesame seeds</li>
  <li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Soak the chickpeas overnight or for at least 8 hours before making this recipe. Strain and wash the chickpeas and boil them with the specified amount of water and 25 grams garlic until they are soft enough to be ground.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/03_SDG_4116.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" />
 If, like me, you are using a pressure cooker, start cooking at a high flame until the first whistle. Then, turn the heat down all the way and cook for ten minutes. Take the pressure cooker off the heat and let the pressure of the steam release gradually, by itself. Strain the boiled chickpeas and the boiled garlic and reserve the excess water. We will use this later.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Wash a beetroot thoroughly. Cut the top/tail and slice into discs. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake at 200°C for 15 minutes or until it is slightly charred on the edges and fragrant.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/04_SDG_4095.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cool down and grind in a mixer until it’s shredded. We don’t need to puree it completely. Reserve separately.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/05_SDG_4120.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the boiled, cooled, chickpeas/garlic in a blender and pulse for 30 seconds.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/06_SDG_4121.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the second quantity of garlic and salt, along with olive oil, water and lime juice in the jar and mix for a minute or so.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/07_SDG_4131.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add ice and blend until the mixture starts becoming creamy.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/08_SDG_4135.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add tahini and beetroot.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blend for approximately a minute and a half, until they are well incorporated.
<img src="/assets/blog_img/rb_hummus/11_SDG_4150.png" alt="" class="responsive-image" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and olive oil. Chill before serving.

I had been thinking about writing for quite some time now but never found the courage to take the leap, until now. Still a bit scared and unsure of how this is supposed to work but c’mon I had to start somewhere! Here’s to learning more and trusting the process even if it paralyses one with fear. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>300 grams of fresh spinach, chopped finely</li>
  <li>300 grams of Amul grated cheddar</li>
  <li>25 grams flax seed</li>
  <li>100 grams almond</li>
  <li>8-10 grams salt</li>
  <li>2 grams dried chilli flakes</li>
  <li>146 grams eggs (roughly 3 eggs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 180ºC</li>
  <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
  <li>Toss spinach and grated cheddar together, gently, in a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Grind flax seed, almonds and salt together so that they are mixed evenly. Sprinkle this mixture over spinach and cheddar cheese mix.</li>
  <li>Add dried chilli flakes, eggs and mix until the ingredients resemble a ‘wet’ dough.</li>
  <li>Shape dough roughly into balls. This could be difficult. However, you can also use you fingers to scoop small amounts of dough and drop them directly onto the baking tray.</li>
  <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. Flip halfway. They should be light golden brown on both sides. Let them rest on the tray or 4-5 minutes.Remove and eat with your favorite condiments!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips and troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you find the dough to be too wet try adding ground almonds in 15 gram increments.<br />
To make the diskettes even cheesier you can press tiny cubes of your favourite cheeses into the center of the diskettes!</p>
