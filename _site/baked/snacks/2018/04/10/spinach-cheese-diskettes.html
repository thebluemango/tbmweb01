<h2>Spinach Cheese Diskettes</h2>

<p>I am really excited to be writing my  first blog post! I had been thinking about writing for quite some time now but never found the courage to take the leap, until now. Still a bit scared and unsure of how this is supposed to work but c’mon I had to start somewhere! Here’s to learning more and trusting the process even if it paralyses one with fear. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>300 grams of fresh spinach, chopped finely</li>
  <li>300 grams of Amul grated cheddar</li>
  <li>25 grams flax seed</li>
  <li>100 grams almond</li>
  <li>8-10 grams salt</li>
  <li>2 grams dried chilli flakes</li>
  <li>146 grams eggs (roughly 3 eggs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 180ºC</li>
  <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
  <li>Toss spinach and grated cheddar together, gently, in a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Grind flax seed, almonds and salt together so that they are mixed evenly. Sprinkle this mixture over spinach and cheddar cheese mix.</li>
  <li>Add dried chilli flakes, eggs and mix until the ingredients resemble a ‘wet’ dough.</li>
  <li>Shape dough roughly into balls. This could be difficult. However, you can also use you fingers to scoop small amounts of dough and drop them directly onto the baking tray.</li>
  <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. Flip halfway. They should be light golden brown on both sides. Let them rest on the tray or 4-5 minutes.Remove and eat with your favorite condiments!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips and troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you find the dough to be too wet try adding ground almonds in 15 gram increments.<br />
To make the diskettes even cheesier you can press tiny cubes of your favourite cheeses into the center of the diskettes!</p>
