I managed to get my hands on some beetroots recently and since I adore hummus, I decided to take it up a notch and give beetroot hummus a try. It’s such a delicious, versatile dip that can be paired with carrots, crackers, pita bread, sandwiches and burgers and it looks amazing. I usually end up eating it with toasted bread or carrots when I need a snack.

I have not added any chilli to this recipe because I didn’t want it to be too spicy. It’s packed with plant-based protein, other essential minerals and fiber (thank you, beetroots!). I have found when I get snacky, having something healthy like hummus in the fridge cuts down on the possibility of ordering takeout!

If you have the ingredients (don’t forget to soak the chickpeas in water for at least 8 hours prior) this recipe can be finished in thirty minutes or less. I like tahini so I usually put it in every time I make hummus, but if you don’t have tahini or don’t like it you can just skip it. This recipe calls for a fair amount of garlic but you can definitely add more or less, if that’s how you prefer it.


<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<i>(for step 1)</i>
- 80 grams chickpeas
- 300 grams water
- 25 grams garlic
- 2 grams salt

<i>(for step 2 and onwards)</i>
- 7 grams garlic
- 3 grams salt
- 30 grams olive oil
- 125 grams water
- 22 grams lime juice
- 25 grams ice cubes
- 20 grams tahini
- 30 grams roasted beetroot

<i>Garnish</i>
- White sesame seeds
- Olive oil

<h3>Method</h3>

1. Soak the chickpeas overnight or for at least 8 hours before making this recipe. Strain and wash the chickpeas and boil them with the specified amount of water and 25 grams garlic until they are soft enough to be ground.

 If, like me, you are using a pressure cooker, start cooking at a high flame until the first whistle. Then, turn the heat down all the way and cook for ten minutes. Take the pressure cooker off the heat and let the pressure of the steam release gradually, by itself. Strain the boiled chickpeas and the boiled garlic and reserve the excess water. We will use this later.
2. Wash a beetroot thoroughly. Cut the top/tail and slice into discs. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake at 200°C for 15 minutes or until it is slightly charred on the edges and fragrant.

3. Cool down and grind in a mixer until it’s shredded. We don’t need to puree it completely. Reserve separately.

4. Put the boiled, cooled, chickpeas/garlic in a blender and pulse for 30 seconds.
