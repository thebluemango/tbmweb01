I am really excited to be writing my  first blog post! I had been thinking about writing for quite some time now but never found the courage to take the leap, until now. Still a bit scared and unsure of how this is supposed to work but c’mon I had to start somewhere! Here’s to learning more and trusting the process even if it paralyses one with fear. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
- 300 grams of fresh spinach, chopped finely
- 300 grams of Amul grated cheddar
- 25 grams flax seed
- 100 grams almond
- 8-10 grams salt
- 2 grams dried chilli flakes
- 146 grams eggs (roughly 3 eggs)

<h3>Method</h3>
1. Preheat your oven to 180ºC
2. Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
3. Toss spinach and grated cheddar together, gently, in a large mixing bowl.
4. Grind flax seed, almonds and salt together so that they are mixed evenly. Sprinkle this mixture over spinach and cheddar cheese mix.
5. Add dried chilli flakes, eggs and mix until the ingredients resemble a ‘wet’ dough.
6. Shape dough roughly into balls. This could be difficult. However, you can also use you fingers to scoop small amounts of dough and drop them directly onto the baking tray.
7. Bake for 12-15 minutes. Flip halfway. They should be light golden brown on both sides. Let them rest on the tray or 4-5 minutes.Remove and eat with your favorite condiments!

<h3>Tips and troubleshooting</h3>
If you find the dough to be too wet try adding ground almonds in 15 gram increments.<br>
To make the diskettes even cheesier you can press tiny cubes of your favourite cheeses into the center of the diskettes!
