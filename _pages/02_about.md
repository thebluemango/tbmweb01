<p>I bake everything that comes out of The Blue Mango. I have previously trained as a lawyer. However, when I shifted to Mumbai in 2015, I realised that my heart lay with desserts.<br>
<br>
I love the magical process of baking my own cookies, cakes, and breads. I started the brand as a self taught baker, in 2017. The first dessert on the menu were chocolate cake and lemon squares. Gradually, more and more desserts made their way to the menu. <br>
<br>
In 2019, I took six months off to study French pastry at Ferrandi Paris. The experience was life-changing and I came back with a refreshed focus and direction. <br>
<br>
Presently, The Blue Mango menu comprises of cakes, eclairs, madeleines, macarons and so much more! Additionally, I put out special menus throughout the year to celebrate events, festivals and ingredients.<br>
<br>
Everything is made on demand and the focus is on bringing you quality desserts made in small batches, prepared lovingly in my kitchen.</p>
